In those few moments the Senate will go into what s known as an  intersession recess,  creating one golden moment when the president could test his recess-appointment powers by sending Judge Garland to the high court.A smattering of activists has asked him to give it a try, but Mr. Obama has given no indication that he s thinking about it. The White House didn t respond to a request for comment for this story.The move would be a legal gamble under the high court s last ruling in 2014 on recess appointments. That 9-0 decision overturned a handful of Mr. Obama s early 2012 picks, saying the Senate was actually in session when the president acted, so he couldn t use his powers.That ruling also said, however, that there s a difference between appointments made during the annual yearlong session of Congress, dubbed  intrasession,  which Mr. Obama used in 2012, and picks made at the end of the year, after Congress adjourns, which are known as  intersession. William G. Ross, a law professor at Samford University in Birmingham, Alabama, said Mr. Obama would have the power to elevate Judge Garland. But he said it would be  politically unwise and damaging to the prestige of the court. The consensus, though, is that Mr. Obama would be making a mistake to test it that theory. I think it s fair to use the word stretch. I don t know why he would try this. It would backfire,  said Louis Fisher, a scholar in residence at the Constitution Project who served for decades as Congress  top expert on separation-of-powers issues.He said Mr. Obama s 9-0 loss in the 2014 case should still be stinging someone who earned his law degree from Harvard University and taught constitutional law at the University of Chicago. Does he want to go down that road again?  Mr. Fisher said. Perhaps most problematic for Mr. Obama is that recess appointments have a shelf life. Even if he succeeds in putting Judge Garland on the bench, the appointment would expire at the close of 2017   and could end even earlier if the Senate confirms a full-fledged replacement named by Mr. Trump.Worse yet for Mr. Obama, Judge Garland would lose his seat on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit   oftentimes dubbed the second-most powerful court in the country. That means the president would be trading a lifetime of Judge Garland for less than a year of Justice Garland. Since Garland could serve only a year, he presumably would accomplish little and his service would be clouded by the strange and controversial circumstances of his appointment,  said Mr. Ross, the law professor.For entire story  Washington Times\",\n          \"Bernie s combination of calling it like it is, and his tendency to get pissed off a little easily at Republicans often results in some epic smackdowns being delivered by him. One of these gems came up again during a Democratic town hall event hosted by CNN.Bernie started to talk about the unprecedented decision by Republicans to essentially cut Obama s final term short to only 3 years by blocking ANY effort at nominating a 9th SCOTUS judge following the death of Antonin Scalia. However, rather than act like it s some kind of new thing, he avoided the rhetoric and called it exactly what it is.It s just the latest link in a very long and unbroken chain of choices made by Republicans to disrespect, delegitimize, and smear the legacy of the first black President of the United States. Yes, Republicans would love to get a SCOTUS judge installed if they can delay until after the election. However, they tip their hand too easily in how they attack Obama compared to other Democrats like Bernie.Pointing out a glaring fact, Bernie mentioned that his father came from Poland yet nobody has asked where HIS birth certificate is. It s so obvious yet no Republican even realizes it. Bernie has just as much of a reason to have his citizenship questioned as President Obama, yet it never occurred to a single Republican to do it. As he said, there s one obvious reason, which he mentions in the video clip.Watch Bernie end the discussion on why Republicans are such incredible idiots below: // < ![CDATA[ (function(d, s, id) { var js, fjs = d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0]; if (d.getElementById(id)) return; js = d.createElement(s); js.id = id; js.src = \\\"//connect.facebook.net/en_US/sdk.js#xfbml=1&#038;version=v2.3\\\"; fjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js, fjs);}(document, 'script', 'facebook-jssdk')); // ]]&gt;Bernie Sanders, speaking at CNN s Democratic Candidates Town Hall, gets off the first zinger of the night at Donald Trump.Posted by Mashable News on Tuesday, February 23, 2016 Featured image via video screen capture\",\n          \"LUSAKA (Reuters) - Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) government forces have been killing civilians in an insurgency-hit region, prompting the latest influx of refugees into northern Zambia, a senior U.N. official said, citing accounts of asylum seekers. Zambia fears a looming humanitarian crisis after more than 6,000 refugees fleeing turmoil in the DRC entered its territory in one month. [L5N1M32S5] Pierrine Aylara, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) chief representative in Zambia, told Reuters that the latest asylum seekers had said they were fleeing Congolese government forces.  It is the government of the DRC that is said to be persecuting its own people by killing, maiming and torching houses, as well as committing rape and looting food stored in granaries,  Aylara said. Thousands of people have been killed and more than one million forced to flee their homes in the DRC s eastern Kasai region since the start of an insurrection nearly a year ago by the Kamuina Nsapu militia. Kamuina Nsapu is demanding the withdrawal of military forces from Kasai. But U.N. monitors noted in a report that the conflict has shifted away from an insurrection of a specific community towards a wider upheaval far beyond its initial confines. A rebel group known as Elema was fighting the government mainly with machetes, bows and arrows in Congo s Haut Katanga and Tanganyika provinces, Aylara said.  The group is not targeting civilians and aims to protect them, but is rather targeting government soldiers, the police as well as government establishments,  she said. The insurgency poses the worst threat yet to the rule of DRC President Joseph Kabila. His refusal to step down at the end of his constitutional mandate last December prompted a wave of killings and lawlessness across the vast central African nation.  In turn, government soldiers have become increasingly brutal to the civilian population as they are unable to tell who does and does not belong to this (rebel) group,  Aylara said. DRC government forces were fighting alongside a tribe known as the Abatembo and targeting the Luba and Tabwa tribes who were believed to be sympathetic to the Elema rebels, she said. Southern African leaders plan to appoint a retired African president to oversee a process aimed at bringing about free and all-inclusive elections in the DRC to help heal the tensions that have caused internal strife and the refugee crisis.     \"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"subject\",\n

A day later, the top Democrat on the intelligence committee said that he hasn t seen one shred of evidence to back up Trump s bogus claim.Rep. Adam Schiff is a member of what is known as the  Gang of Eight,  which is the group of House members who are privy to the most classified information out there. Schiff said that Thursday s meeting with Comey didn t provide the committee with any evidence whatsoever that Trump s phones had been tapped by Obama or anyone else. I think when Sean Spicer isn t even willing to talk about it, you know there s a real problem,  Schiff told CNN.Rep. Devin Nunes, who is the Republican heading up the intelligence committee, said earlier this week that he hadn t seen any evidence to support Trump s wiretapping claims either. After meeting with Comey, he said that nothing had changed.Comey has said previously that Trump is full of it when it comes to the allegations of his phones being tapped. Schiff thinks Comey will answer questions regarding this fiasco during a committee hearing scheduled for later this month. He certainly is prepared for the question,  Schiff told CNN.  I don t see any reason why he wouldn t answer it. He might even welcome the opportunity. Trump decided last weekend that he would get on Twitter and accuse Obama of tapping the phones at Trump Tower, even if he had no evidence to back up this allegation.Terrible! Just found out that Obama had my  wires tapped  in Trump Tower just before the victory. Nothing found. This is McCarthyism!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 4, 2017How low has President Obama gone to tapp my phones during the very sacred election process. This is Nixon/Watergate. Bad (or sick) guy!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 4, 2017Featured image via Win McNamee/Getty Images\",\n          \"CNN host Anderson Cooper s reactions to Kellyanne Conway throughout this interview are priceless.After firing FBI Director James Comey on Tuesday, the wicked witch of the White House made her return to the cable news circuit to spout more bullshit in defense of her mentally defective boss.Conway was repeatedly reminded that Trump loved Comey during the 2016 campaign, but she repeatedly made an ass of herself by pretending that candidate Trump no longer exists. As a candidate, Donald Trump praised James Comey,  Cooper said.  Donald Trump talked about this on the campaign all the time. All of sudden the White House is concerned about James Comey s handling of Hillary Clinton s email? I think you re looking at the wrong set of facts here, Anderson,  Conway bewilderingly replied.  In other words you re going back to the campaign. This is the president of the United States, he acted decisively today, he acted at the direction of his deputy attorney general. He makes complete sense because he has lost confidence in the FBI director and he took the recommendation of Rob Rosenstein, the deputy attorney general who has been on the job for two weeks. Cooper then proceeded to grill Conway. That makes no sense,  he fired back.  He said one thing as candidate and now he s concerned as president? Clearly, this White House is under investigation, the people around the president are under investigation. You would agree with that, yes? In defiance of the facts, Conway disagreed and whined about people who are  obsessed  with Russia. Then she argued that since she s around Trump and not under investigation that others cannot be. I m around the president,  Conway said.  I m not under investigation. So that person doesn t exist anymore?  Cooper asked.  Candidate Donald Trump, that s a fictional character we are no longer allowed to refer to? We can only refer to the Donald Trump who exists today? Conway accused Cooper of being mean and claimed that Trump fired Comey because he  needs confidence in his FBI director and he doesn t have it. Throughout the interview, Cooper can be seen reacting to Conway s most inane responses with facial expressions. At one point, he even rolled his eyes because of how ridiculous her answers were.Here s the video via YouTube.Clearly, CNN wasted their time and ours by inviting Conway on to spread Trump s propaganda. The only thing saving this interview is Copper s reactions to being gaslighted.The only reason why Trump fired Comey is because the FBI is investigating his Russia scandal. Trump just impeded that investigation and obstructed justice by firing the man in charge of it. Now Trump will likely put someone in charge who will drop the investigation. This is exactly the kid of shady shit that Richard Nixon did in order to cover-up his involvement in Watergate. He resigned rather than face impeachment. Trump should not only face impeachment, he should actually be impeached and put in prison.Featured Image: Screenshot\",\n          \"PARIS (Reuters) - The Kremlin-funded Russian broadcaster RT was due to launch its French language news channel on Monday night amid heavy suspicion by the government and President Emmanuel Macron who has dubbed it  an organ of propaganda . Macron has led official criticism of RT, formerly known as  Russia Today , and openly accused it of sowing disinformation about him via its website and social media during the presidential election earlier this year which he won. RT has denied the allegations and RT France s chief executive Xenia Fedorova, speaking at the channel s new offices in a western Paris suburb, again brushed off criticism, saying that RT stood for news  not covered by mainstream media . The channel was being cold-shouldered by Macron and the channel had still not been granted accreditation to cover news conferences inside the French presidential Elysee palace, Fedorova said on Monday a few hours before the channel was due to start broadcasting.  There was just one example of when we actually managed to visit. That was actually during the Trump visit to Paris,  she added, referring to the visit by the U.S. president last in July.  A spokesman for the French government said last week that the current administration was concerned by encroachment on  freedom of expression but highlighted that RT was owned by a foreign power.  Fedorova brushed off the remarks, citing other well-known international news channels that receive public funding such as BBC World, France 24 or Al Jazeera.   RT stands for news that are not covered by the mainstream media,  she said.    We will keep the platform (open) to perspectives and opinions that are either not covered or silenced.  RT France has planned a budget of 20 million euros  ($24 million) for its launch and aims to recruit a total of 150 people by the end next year.  By comparison, BFM TV, France s number one news channel, started with 15 million euros and now has an annual budget of about 60 million euros.  RT s first international channel was launched in December 2005. The network broadcasts in English, Arabic and Spanish and its programs are viewed by 70 million people in 38 countries, it says.  The landscape for news channels is already crowded in France, with four round-the-clock local news channels. Unlike its rivals, RT will not reach all French households via the digital terrestrial television technology. Rather, it can be viewed only online or by subscribers of Iliad s broadband services. Bouygues Telecom is also due to distribute RT France from the end of next February.  The two biggest French telecom operators, Orange and Altice s SFR Group, are still in discussions with RT France, the firms said, underscoring the low audience level that RT is likely to have in its first few days. Russia s international news outlets have come under the spotlight since 2016 after being accused of meddling in the U.S. presidential election.  Russia has denied interfering in the election.  In October, Twitter accused RT and Russian news agency Sputnik of interfering in the 2016 U.S. election and banned them from buying ads on its network.
